This is a fun little python script that I coded to cheat at an iPhone game. 


Recently, I purchased an iPhone after my old phone kicked the bucket. I've 
never owned an iPhone before, and the only reason I got one is so that I could
play the GamePigeon SMS games that iPhone has. One person keeps beating me at 
the Anagrams game so I challenged myself as a first project to build a script
that will take the letters that you're prompted with in Anagrams, and output
every possible word combination for easy cheating. 


I'm not actually going to use this script to cheat, but it was a fun challenge and 
a cool proof of concept. Plus, if I (or you) were to actually want to cheat, there are
plenty of online resources that have much fancier GUI's than my little script. 


The script does not work without a .txt file as a wordbank (look at my bankgenerator page
to see how I created this wordbank) and the syntax is as follows:

  python3 anagramscheat.py [text_file.txt]

I have also include the requirements.txt file to load the environment that I used for this script.


If you don't want to use my environment, I've also included an .exe version of the script, 
and the syntax to run it this way is as follows:

  anagramscheat.exe [text_file.txt]

This has been a huge amount of fun and a great way for me to not only get a little bit better with
python, but also to learn more about Git, setting up environments, and polishing my projects 
to make them shareable.
